#Step 1 Cream together eggs and sugar
To prepare this delicious cake recipe, preheat the oven at 180 degrees C. Next, take a mixing bowl and crack open the eggs in it. After that add sugar in the eggs and beat them using an electric beater. This will cream the mixture and make it thick. Beat them for about 5-7 minutes. In the end, the mixture will double in size.

#Step 2 Prepare the cake batter
For making the cake batter, add vanilla extract along with butter in the egg-sugar mixture and whisk well for about 2-3 minutes. Next, add the all-purpose flour and mix well until combined. Make sure no lumps are remaining. Finally, add the cranberries in flour batter and mix well.

#Step 3 Bake the cake for 40-50 minutes
Now, take a cake tin and grease it with butter very well. Dust a little with flour and transfer the cake batter in it. Spread to smoothen the batter and place inside the preheated oven. Bake the cake for 40-50 minutes, and check once after 40 minutes using a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the cake is baked else let it cook for 5 more minutes.

#Step 4 Let it cool and enjoy
Once the cake baked and is brown in colour, take it out of the oven and let it cool completely. Cut as many slices as you want and serve freshly baked Cranberry Cake in your Christmas party. You can decorate the cake with some fresh cranberries and dust some icing sugar over the cake. Enjoy!
